# SQL-Projects

This project consists of data exploration and data cleaning with SQL, using 2 different datasets. 

1. Covid Data
I explore the data to see how COVID-19 has impacted the world. Total cases and deaths is explored specifically for country such as Australia, and also see how it is compared to the rest of the world in terms of infection rate and death rate. I also explore the vaccination statistics all over the world. 

2. Nashville Housing Data
Utilizing SQL, I perform the data cleaning procedure such as convert the data type, dealing with missing data, splitting columns, and altering the table to change the values.
